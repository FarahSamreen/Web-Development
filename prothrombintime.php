    <h1>Prothrombin time</h1>
    <p class="text">
      A prothrombin time (PT) test measures how long it takes for a clot to form
      in a blood sample. An INR (international normalized ratio) is a type of
      calculation based on PT test results. Prothrombin is a protein made by the
      liver. It is one of several substances known as clotting (coagulation)
      factors.<br />
      If you are not taking blood thinning medicines, such as warfarin, the
      normal range for your PT results is: 11 to 13.5 seconds. INR of 0.8 to
      1.1.
